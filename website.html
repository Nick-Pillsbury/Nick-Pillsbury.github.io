            <h1>My First Website</h1>

            <p>
                Embarking on the journey of web development, I took the plunge to create my first website.
                The primary goal was to showcase my resume and future personal projects.
                This project marked my initiation into the world of web development, 
                where I acquired a solid foundation and gained valuable insights.
                It proved to be an engaging experience that allowed me to acquire new skills and concepts.

                Looking ahead, I envision continual updates to this website, incorporating future projects.
                To enhance the aesthetics and functionality, I plan to refine my HTML and CSS abilities, 
                striving for a more polished and professional appearance.
                Additionally, I want to learn some JavaScript to introduce functionality and elevate the overall website.
